# Library-Database
This is a Library system I built with C++. It can add manage a libraries inventory of books and offers other functionality as well.

The idea behind the design was to use my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and modular design to create classes for each component of the program. For example, a Book class, 
a Publication class, and a Menu class. The program reads from a database stored as a text file. To make sure each item in the database is read and stored correctly, I made read
and write functions that overload the input and output operators. When the program is run, the user will be prompted with a menu that allows them to add a new book or publication,
delete a book or publication, checkout an item from the library, return an item to the library, or to exit (with an option to save). Depending on the option a user chooses, they 
can search for a publication by typing the name or they may add a publication to the database by typing in all of its information. This was made possible using class inheritance, 
class functionality, and dynamic memory allocation. 

By doing this project, I learned how Object Oriented Programming works, how to implement modular design, dynamic memory allocation 
and how to use pointers and references to make my code neat and efficient.
